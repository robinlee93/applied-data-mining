The topics are over-fitting and model-tuning.\r\n\\end{abstract}\r\n\r\n\\section{Exercise 4.1}\r\nConsider the music genre data set described in Sect. 1.4. The objective\r\nfor these data is to use the predictors to classify music samples into the\r\nappropriate music genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\subsection{What data splitting method(s) would you use for these data? Explain.}\r\nThe outcomes of the music genre data are not balanced. Also the  samples are not indepent.\r\nThe sample size is not too small -``there were 12,495 music samples for which 191 characteristics were determined.\"\r\n\r\nSince the sample size is large enough, I'd use simple 10-fold cross validation. Since the objective doesn't involve classifying newer music, I'd use random approach.\r\n\r\n\\subsection{Using tools described in this chapter, provide code for implementing your\r\napproach(es).}\r\n<< eval=FALSE>>=\r\nlibrary(caret)\r\ncvSplit = createFolds(data$outcome, k=10, returnTrain = TRUE)\r\n@\r\n\r\n\r\n\\section{Exercise 4.3}\r\nPartial least squares (Sect. 6.3) was used to model the yield of a chemical\r\nmanufacturing process (Sect. 1.4). The data can be found in the AppliedPredictiveModeling\r\npackage and can be loaded using\r\n\r\n<<>>=\r\nlibrary(AppliedPredictiveModeling)\r\ndata(ChemicalManufacturingProcess)\r\n@\r\nThe objective of this analysis is to find the number of PLS components\r\nthat yields the optimal R2 value (Sect. 5.1). PLS models with 1 through 10\r\ncomponents were each evaluated using five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation\r\nand the results are presented in the following table:\r\n\r\n\\subsection{Using the ``one-standard error\" method, what number of PLS components\r\nprovides the most parsimonious model?}\r\nThe model with 3 components.\r\n\r\n\\subsection{Compute the tolerance values for this example. If a 10\\% loss in R2 is\r\nacceptable, then what is the optimal number of PLS components?}\r\nThe numerically optimal value is 54.5\\%. Anything above 49.05\\% works. I would choose 2 components (50\\%). \r\n\r\n\\subsection{Several other models (discussed in Part II) with varying degrees of complexity\r\nwere trained and tuned and the results are presented in Fig. 4.13.\r\nIf the goal is to select the model that optimizes R2, then which model(s)\r\nwould you choose, and why?}\r\n\r\nRandom forest. It has the highest R2\r\n\r\n\\subsection{Prediction time, as well as model complexity (Sect. 4.8) are other factors\r\nto consider when selecting the optimal model(s). Given each modelâ€™s prediction\r\ntime, model complexity, and R2 estimates, which model(s) would\r\nyou choose, and why?}\r\n\r\nI would choose SVM, because it has the second to highest R2 and a low prediction time. SVM is not too complex.\r\n\r\n\\end{document}\r\n",
